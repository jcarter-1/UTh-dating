# Cheng et al. (2018) Hulu MSD Test

Cheng et al. (2018) present a high detailed (n > 100) U-Th and 14C record of two stalagmites from Hulu Cave from Xiaobailong Cave, Yunnan, China. In this section, we take a subset of these samples to aid in the visualisation of the effect of initial on ages. In particular, we focus on how the initial thorium and the measured 232Th/238U work in tandem to amplify the effect of initial thorium when corrected using the Kaufman and Broecker, 1965 age equation.
